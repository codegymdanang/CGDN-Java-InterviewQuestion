##Nội dung câu hỏi và phần trả lời

## [ Câu hỏi ] 1. Could you describe about Strong typed?
```
- Check variables at compile time
- Weak typed: check variables at runtime (script languages such as: JavaScript, PHP…). 
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 2. What does static keyword mean?
```
- Class resources 
- Used for method, attributes, inner class. 
- Available for all objects. 
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 3. Describe the principles of OOPs.
```
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism. 
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 4. Explain about Polymorphism.
```
- One name many forms
- Override, overload methods. 
- Increase flexibility. 
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 5. Explain about Inheritance.
```
- Increase reusability
- Extends class, implements interface. 
- Is – a relationship. 
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 6. Explain about Encapsulation.
```
- Hiding information and data. 
- Use access modifier(public, protected, private) 
- Make the system more modularized. 
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 7. Explain about the different forms of Polymorphism?
```
- Overriding
- Overloading
- Anonymous class. 
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 8. What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
```
- Java method has five elements: modifiers, return types, names, parameters, exceptions. 
a. Overloading method: 
- Same names
- Others are flexible
b. Overriding:  
- Same names
- Same parameters (number and type, order)
- Access modifier is less restrict
- Return type: same type or covariant type. (equal or narrower) 
- Exception: Checked exception (equal or narrower); flexible runtime exceptions. 
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 9. What is dynamic binding?
```
- Binding: Association btw reference and actual object. 
- Binding at runtime (Overriding method). 
- Static binding: at compile time.
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 10. Explain about Abstraction?
```
- Increase extendability. 
- Increase abstraction of layered architecture. 
- Use interface or abstract class. 
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 11. Could you explain composition and inheritance in JAVA?
```
- Composition: Has – a relationship. (Famous example: Object Adapter pattern) 
- Inheritance: Is – a relationship. (Class adapter pattern). 
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 12.  Exception handling with composition and inheritance?
```
- Inheritance:
o An overriding method can throw any uncheck exceptions
o An overriding method can throw narrower or fewer exceptions than the overridden method.
- Composition:
o Use try-catch block or throws exception when re-use method which throws exception
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 13. What are differences between abstract class and interface?
```
- Implementation
- Characteristics of method and attribute
- Purpose of using. 
a. Abstract class: 
- Single inheritance with “extends” key word
- Could have both abstract and concrete methods. Attributes are normal as normal classes. 
- Use when we want to have common behaviors for subclasses. 
b. Interface: 
- Support for multiple inheritance. 
- Have only abstract methods
- Provide the contract. 
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 14. What equals() and hashCode() method respond for?
```
- Equals() method: 
o Compare logically two objects. 
- hashCode(): 
o An integer number associcated with the objects using for storing and retriving in demands.
- Both methods are useful when we want to store objects in hash collection or set duplicate elements. 
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 15. How and when override them?
```
- Equals() method: 
o Public boolean equals(Object obj){} (must pass Object type)
o Check null -> check instanceof -> compare properties. 
- Hashcode(): 
o Public int hashCode(){}
o Based on attributes we implement an agorithm to generate distinct numbers. 
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 16. What is the difference between equals() and “==” ?
```
- equals(): Compare logically. 
- “==” : Compare address.
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 17. What are differences between Comparator and Comparable? 
```
- Comparable: 
o Override compareTo(Object obj)
- Comparator: 
o Act as the third party
o Override compare(Object obj1, Object obj2)
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 18. Comparable interface? When to use them?
```
- Comparable: implement to compare an object itself with another.
- Use: 
o Avoid duplicate elements on Set  
o Sort collections or array by using Collections.sort(collection) and Arrays.sort(array)
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 19.  Is it possible to use multiple comparator?
```
- Yes
- With each criterion,  we have implement Comparator interface
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 20. What is garbage collection? Can we enforce garbage collection to perform?
```
- GC: 
o JVM mechanism for collecting unused objects and removing them. 
o Purpose: optimize and save memory. 
o Couldn’t enforce but could register: 
 Object.finalize()
 Call gc() method of System and Runtime.
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 21. What are differences between ArrayList and Vector?
```
- ArrayList:

```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 26.  How to sort a list?
```
- Implements Comparable -> Use Collections.sort();
- Implements Comparator -> Use Collections.sort(list, comparator);
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 27. How to check duplicated elements in the Set?
```
- Override equals() and hashCode(). 
- Wrong implementation of equals() can lead to memory leak problem. 
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 28.  How to find common elements in two sets? 
```
- Solution 1: Iterate two sets then check in loops one by one
- Solution 2: Move elements to two lists then sort lists -> check common element with an efficient algorithm.
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 29.  How to find + remove duplicated elements in a list?
```
- Solution 1: Convert it to a set then set contains no duplicate objects.
- Solution 2: Sort the list then compare continuous objects faster.
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 30. What is Iterator? How to use it? 
```

```
- Pass by value: 
o Pass only the bit-pattern (copy) of value. 
o Method can’t change the variable value. 
- Pass by reference: 
o Receive a pointer of variable. 
o Java only supports Pass by value
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 41. What are differences between Deep copy and Shallow copy?
```
- Deep copy: 
o Duplicate everything (Collection: structure + elements). 
- Shallow copy: 
o Copy as little as possible. (Collection: only structure + shared elements). 
```

```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 45. Can you explain in short how JAVA exception handlings work?

o Caused by bad input
o Can handle 
o Eg: NullPointerException, IndexOutOfBoundException…
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 48. What is serialization?
```
- Proccess to convert object to byte-stream for transferring through network or writing to disk.
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 49. How do we implement serialization actually?
```
- Implement Serializable interface.
- Use writeObject() and readObject() to serialize and deserialize
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 50. What's the use of Externalizable interface?
```
- Purpose: to increase performance in some specific situations.

```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 51. What's difference between thread and process?
```
- Thread:
o Path of execution run on CPU, light weighted process
o Related threads share same data memory 
o Have their own individual stacks

o Every process has its own data memory location
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 52. What is thread safety and synchronization?  
```
- Thread safe:
o A method that can run safely in multithread environment without any resource confliction.

o Assure resources (variable, object, method…) are not accessed by multiple threads at the same time
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 53. What is semaphore?
```
- Object – helps one thread communicate with another to synchronize their operation
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 54. What is deadlock? How do you detect them? Do you handle them? And finally, how do you prevent them from occurring?
```
- Lock: multiple processes access same resource at the same time
- Deadlock: two thread waiting another in a cycle
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 55.  You run the application on Tomcat and run out of memory. What will you do?
```
- Check log file
- Use VisualVM to analyze
```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 56. What is Stack and Heap Memory?
```
- Heap:
o Stores class instance + arrays
o Shared memory
- Non-heap:
o ‘method area’
- Stack memory:

```
## [ Câu hỏi ] 57.  How could you solve the memory leak?
```
- Use good Java best practices 
- Consider static resources, set empty collections...
- Minimize the variable scopes
- Use tools to check before release applications
```
